				<h5> Increased rate of garbage</h5>
				<p>The expansion of human activities into the natural landscapes, mostly manifested by urbanization and agriculture developments, has led to the reduction and fragmentation of wildlife habitats and loss of valuable Fauna and Flora. It seems that human beings, who are always regarding themselves as the dominant species because of their cleverness and inventiveness, are pushing the earth into a danger zone.

				<h5>Root of environmental degradation </h5>
				<p>The cause of environmental degradation is deeply rooted in human culture. Through hundreds of years of industrialization and exploitation of natural resources, humans are acting on the assumption that we are the dominant species on earth. In a world emphatically and unabashedly upholding materialistic standard, people are motivated to exploit more natural resources.

				<h5>Extiction of wild animals</h5>
				<p>An extinct in the wild (EW) species is one which has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as only known by living members kept in captivity or as a naturalized population outside its historic range due to massive habitat loss.</p>

				<h5>Irish Elk </h5>
				<p>Irish Elk evolved around 400,000 years ago, and died out approximately 5,000 years ago. It is likely that hunting by humans contributed to their extinction. </p>

				<h5>Smilodon </h5>
				<p>The Smilodon (saber-toothed cat) lived in North and South America at the end of the last glacial period, though it evolved as a separate species around 2.5 million years ago. However, the Smilodon's extinction coincides with the arrival of humans who were known to have hunted many native species. </p>

				<h5>Wolly Mammoth</h5>
				<p>The Woolly Mammoth had long tusks for fighting and foraging, and these were sought after by humans. They were hunted for food as well, but it's likely that their extinction was expedited by climate change at the end of the last glacial period.</p>

				<h5>Pinta Island Tortoise</h5>
				<p>The Pinta Island tortoise was a subspecies of giant tortoise that lived. It was hunted prolifically for food, and its habitat was destroyed in the 1950s when goats were brought to the island. Efforts were made to conserve the animal, but by 1971 only one remained. Despite attempts to mate other tortoises with George, none of the eggs hatched, and he died in 2012, the last of his kind.</p>
